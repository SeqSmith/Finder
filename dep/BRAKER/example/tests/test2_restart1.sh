# --gm_max_intergenic 10000 option is used here only to make the test run faster.

# achieved by adjusting this option is negligible on full-sized genomes.

# Warning: the result of this particular test can slightly differ from the full
# test run (test2.sh) because the protein hints supplied to GeneMark-EP+ in this
# test are from ProtHint's second iteration, while in the regular run, GeneMark-EP+
# uses result from ProtHint's first iteration (see BRAKER2 paper for details).
