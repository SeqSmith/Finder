* trimmed-wig - This folder contains some coverage files created from 
                the trimmed RNA-Seq data in wiggle-format (both formats)
                
************************************************

This folder contains the following files:

* lib1.introns.ff.gff - This file contains the intron hints created from the aligned and filtered
                        BLAT alignments of the used RNA-Seq data 
                        This file contains only introns with a GTAC splice-site
				
* ref-introns.gff - This file contains the introns of all the RefSeq UTRs

* repeats.gff - This file contains the repeats hints created with RepMasker from the used RNA-Seq data

* start_stop.gff - This file contains start and stop codons from human chromosome 19

* trimmed05.blat.sf.gff - Unfiltered introns with all splice sites (no specific splice site)
													Trimmed (5%)

* trimmed05.blat.sf.gtag.gff - This file contains introns (GTAG splice-site) created 
                               from the aligned and trimmed (5%) RNA-Seq data in GFF-format

* The file chr19.fa for testing can be downloaded with

wget http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/augustus/binaries/auxprogs/utrrnaseq/input/human-chr19/chr19.fa
  
             This file contains the for the evaluation used genome sequence.
             The sequence is a human chromosome 19 sequence.
             The file is formatted in FASTA-format.
